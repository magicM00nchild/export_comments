## README

This Python script is designed to retrieve comments from an Instagram post using the Facebook Graph API and export them to a JSON file. It also provides functionality to filter comments based on specific fields and enumerate them.

### Prerequisites
- You need to have a Facebook Developer account.
- Access Token: Generate an access token with necessary permissions from [Facebook Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer).
  - Required permissions: `pages_show_list`, `ads_management`, `business_management`, `instagram_basic`, `instagram_manage_comments`, `pages_read_engagement`.

### Usage
1. Replace the `post_id` variable with the Instagram Post ID from which you want to retrieve comments.
2. Replace the `access_token` variable with your generated access token.
3. Run the script.

### Functionality
- `get_comments(post_id, access_token)`: Retrieves comments from the specified Instagram post.
- `get_comment_author(comment_id, access_token)`: Retrieves the username of the author of a comment.
- `enumerate_comments(comments)`: Enumerates comments with entry numbers.
- `filter_comments_fields(comments, fields)`: Filters comments based on specified fields.
- `export_to_json(comments, file_name)`: Exports comments to a JSON file.
- `main()`: Main function to orchestrate the execution of the script.

### Example
In the provided script, comments are retrieved from the Instagram post with the given Post ID. The retrieved comments are then filtered to include only the `text` and `username` fields. The filtered comments are exported to a JSON file named `comments_with_usernames_2.json`.

Please ensure you have the necessary permissions and configurations set up before running the script. For further details, refer to the comments within the script and the prerequisites mentioned above.
